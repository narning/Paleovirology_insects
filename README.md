# Paleovirology_insects
12-week rotation project in Paleovirology 2018

This project is directed towards sceening for endogenous viral elements (EVEs) within insect genomes through the means of sequence similarity

I will commit every script I write, but only bigger more meaningful scripts will be fully annotated and written with a broader userbase in mind
